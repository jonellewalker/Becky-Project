# Research Proposal: The #Becky Project

## Research Topic

*“He only want me when I’m not there/ He better call Becky with the good hair”*

In April 2016, Beyonce’s song “Sorry” pushed the slang term “Becky” back into the dominant cultural discourse as the digital sphere delightfully scrambled to identify the duplicitous woman to whom the singer refers. The term “Becky,” however, is general rather than specific; it refers to a stereotypical white woman, especially one known for skill or enthusiasm for performing oral sex. In the intervening years, pop culture conversation has adopted the word as a colloquialism for white women or even whiteness more broadly. This project seeks to trace the digital life of “Becky” with the hypothesis that understanding “Becky” will likely help us better understand how white womanhood is continually constructed and reconstructed as a social identity through performativity, that is the repeated actions of “doing” race and gender, in this case online.

## Relevant Research Areas & Literature

#### The research areas and literature supporting this project would include:
* Feminist digital studies, including #TransformDH;
* Feminist ethnography and reflexive methodologies;
* Theories of situated knowledge, including the contributions of Black Feminist Thought and Donna Haraway;
* Critical whiteness studies; and
* Queer theory, particularly the pathbreaking contributions of Judith Butler’s gender performativity and Roderick Ferguson’s queer of color critique.

#### The research areas and literature most supported by this project would include:
* Studies of cultural production, including English, Theatre Studies, and Art History, among others;
* Feminist performance theory, specifically theories of performativity;
* Critical race theory, specifically theories of performativity and Foucauldian models of identity;
* Internet culture students, include anthropology and broad cultural criticism; and,
* Theories of performance and the digital, particularly around issues of liveness, memory, and embodiment.

## Research Question

How does the performativity of white femininity articulate itself through cycles of creating and consuming digital media? Further, is it possible to archive the affective experience of white feminine performativity, thereby making a radical intervention into the very process we archive?

## Subjects of Study

This project will collect data from two subjects. First, the project will collect and curate digital media – video, music, podcasts, social media posts, memes, etc. – that reference “Becky,” organizing them into a data visualization of the philosophical total of “Becky.” Second, the project will collect audio interviews with white millennial femmes (born 1980-1995) in the DC/Maryland/Virginia metropolitan region about “Becky,” their relationship to the meme, and their understanding of their own race/gender nexus.

## Anticipated Methods

From data collection through interface, there are five major anticipated methods for my project.

The primary data collection will reflect the dual nature of the project: digital media will be collected using Social Feed Manager and interview audio will be collected using analog feminist ethnography methods. Interviewees will be selected using a fairly informal process, likely developing an initial pool from the University of Maryland campus using social media and e-mail outreach. Interviewees will be compensated for their time and, following feminist ethnography ethics, they will then become contributors to the project as cooperative curators of their own archived affect and memories.

There are three anticipated methods for creating the #Becky Project deliverables. First, an idea map or other data visualization of the digital media will be created using Paper Machines. Second, the interview audio will be hosted using SoundCloud, thereby making the material available on two platforms. Finally, the website serving as the home space for these materials will be created using Scalar; the nature of that website is still in development; however, the project intends to take full advantage of the creative flexibility of this tool.
