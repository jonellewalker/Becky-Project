# MITH735 Class Charter

## Shared Principles and Goals:

* Create space welcoming of all digital skills levels, no assumption of familiarity with concepts, applications, tools.
* Make no assumptions of expertise.
* No performativity and no knocking the new.
* Create a welcoming space and encouraging atmosphere which fosters curiosity and  tinkering.
* Emphasize feminist knowledge production, including critical generosity, transcending our comfort zones, and balancing generous and support.
* Avoid concept creep or discipline creep by offering a disciplinary view when helpful, but never assume that particular view is necessarily the right one at the time.
* Recognize that we each bring our whole selves, expertises, and positionalities to our work.
* Hold space for our full humanity, because we are more than our titles and have full lives alongside our professionalism.

## Our Modes of Work:
* Clear expectations of working hours, with the expectation that collaborators will respond to e-mails within 24-48 hours and practice lazy consensus.
* Share expertise, but do not over-extend requests for instruction.
Communicate using e-mail, AirTable and ELMS.
* Communicate working habits without expecting others to have the same.
* Use tiered feedback, either offering three pieces of praise for every criticism or utilizing the pop/questions/what if method.
One break per class.
* Checking in with classmates on life and school, using a “good & done” or “praise reports” practice.
* Come with questions, as facilitation is shared among us.

## Sustainability Considerations:
As we are working on distinct projects with unique sustainability needs and considerations, we agree to help each other develop reasonable sustainability strategies for our projects as appropriate. We will each seek funding and other sustainable and environmentally conscious ways to produce our projects. We agree to share any sources that may be appropriate for our individual projects.

## Statement on Shared Credit:
Because we are working on separate project autonomously, we agree to acknowledge each other as helpful to the work if it every reaches a public deliverable stage, but not to share credit per se. We are dedicated to ethically supporting each other and acknowledging that our projects were formed within a community of engaged and dynamic scholars.
